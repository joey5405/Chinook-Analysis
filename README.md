# Chinook-Analysis

The chinook database is representative of a digital media store. In this project, we will be using sqlite to explore some areas of the store's operation and using matplotlib to visualize the results. Finally, we will be making comments as to what these results mean and some recommendations as to what the company could do going forward.

This project was done under minimal guidance from the dataquest online data science programme.

The Schema diagram was created using microsoft visio and based on the schema diagram given by dataquest.
